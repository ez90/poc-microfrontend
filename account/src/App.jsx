    <p>ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m the feature application account using states and redux !</p>
    <p>
      This example is based on redux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feature application account use a state of main application for handle connection and use his own state to display the following modal :
    </p>
    <ShowModalButton />
    <p>
      To avoid conflicts between states of each application. We can imagine naming convention for keys of reducers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This example show you that our architecture can manage multi states ðŸ™‚
    </p>
    <ModalProvider>
      <Modal />
    </ModalProvider>
  </>
