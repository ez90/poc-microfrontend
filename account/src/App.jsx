    <h1>Usage of multi state</h1>
    <p>ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m the feature application account using a global state from the main application and an internal state !</p>
    <p>
      This example is based on redux.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a first reducer with the key "user" instanciated by the main application.<br />
      This reducer manage the connexion of a user.<br />
      If a user is connected, the name is displayed in the header in main application.<br />
      The feature application account also deals with this reducer (it manages the action of connection/disconnection).
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a second reducer with the key "modal" instanciated by the feature application account.<br />
      This reducer handle the display of an internal modal connection.
    </p>
    <ShowModalButton />
    <p>
      To avoid conflicts between states of each application. We can imagine naming convention for keys of reducers.

    <p>
      This example show you that our architecture can manage multi states ðŸ™‚
